Something that I've been quietly working on for the last while is finally ready for you to check out. ![](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp45/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/SSKTN-Logo.png "SSKTN Logo") SSKTN.com is my podcasting network. Right now we just have a couple of shows we're doing but I'm hoping to add more as time permits. You can read more about the backstory on where SSKTN came from [on the about page](http://ssktn.com/about/). **Shows**

*   [Welcome to the Internet](http://ssktn.com/shows/welcome-to-the-internet/) is a weekly(ish) podcast where I'll be interviewing folks involved in technology and the arts. Our first interview launched this morning with Hemant Naidu of Naidu Photography - [be sure to check it out](http://ssktn.com/podcasts/welcometotheinternet/002-welcome-to-the-internet-hemant-naidu/) and leave a comment.
*   [Surviving Survivor](http://ssktn.com/shows/surviving-survivor/) is a weekly podcast that I am doing with my wife, Sue, where we chat about the television show Survivor. It started out as a way for me to test the waters of doing a podcast, talking into a mic and setting up a show - but we have lots of fun doing it each week so we'll continue at least until the show is done this season.

I'm hoping to attract some sponsorship/advertisers to some of the shows we'll be doing to help cover costs and build for the future. I'll be sure to chat about that whenever I can. Like what you hear? Got an idea for a show? I'd love to hear about it. [Leave me a note on the contact form](http://ssktn.com/contact/) and we'll chat.
