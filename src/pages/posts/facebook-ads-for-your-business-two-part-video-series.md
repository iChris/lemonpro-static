I often get asked by clients about Facebook advertising and how to get started with it and so I thought I'd put together a screencast/tutorial video on how Facebook advertising works. You can go watch [part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhSK3I116sk) or [part 2](http://youtu.be/8Yy8nZVsXlY) on YouTube directly or I've embedded them below. It's intended to be a general overview of setting up and getting an ad on Facebook - a part 3 is in the works if people are interested on looking at the analytics you get back from running your reports. I've done plenty of other screencasts that I've posted to [my YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/LemonProductionsCa) but never one of this scope so I'd love to hear your feedback and thoughts. Too fast? Too slow? Too much information? Not enough? Leave a comment below or [visit my contact page to send me something directly](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/contact/).
