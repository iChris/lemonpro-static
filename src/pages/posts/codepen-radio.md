\[gallery type="rectangular" link="none" ids="1898,1900,1901"\] CodePen Radio is a cool show that exposes all the fun and frustrations of running an online web business. [CodePen.io](http://codepen.io) is one of the premiere playground sites for the front end of web design - messing around with HTML, CSS, and other web languages in a way that allows you to show off and collaborate on your work. The CodePen co-founders along with employees and other guests appear on CodePen Radio regularly hashing out the kinds of conversations typically reserved for private Slack channels. Anyone looking to start or run a web business would do well to listen in to CodePen Radio regularly.
