My latest tutorial video is my longest to date - but it covers everything you need to get started with a WordPress blog from signing up with a hosting company ([A Small Orange](http://www.asmallorange.com?a_aid=ichris)), picking a domain name, installing WordPress, configuring a custom theme, which plugins to install all the way to your first post. Check out [Setting Up a WordPress Blog from Scratch](http://learningwith.chrisenns.com/setting-wordpress-blog-scratch/) on my new home for tutorial videos over at [Learningwith.ChrisEnns.com](http://learningwith.chrisenns.com) or [watch it directly on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dQr69-dkbU).

### Isn't This What I'd Pay You To Do For Me?

It's a great question and it could very possibly be true. But I believe that by sharing information like [these tutorial videos](http://learningwith.chrisenns.com) I can help more folks get up and publishing on their website AND demonstrate my ability to be paid good money to do it for you if you don't have the time or inclination to do it yourself. If you'd like to hire me to help you with any or all of getting a WordPress site going, [be sure to contact me today](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/contact/).
