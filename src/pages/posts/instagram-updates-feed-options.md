Instagram [updated their app today](http://blog.instagram.com/post/157572774352/170222-multiple) to allow sharing of multiple photos + one video per post:

> With this update, you no longer have to choose the single best photo or video from an experience you want to remember. Now, you can combine up to 10 photos and videos in one post and swipe through to see them all. In feed, youâ€™ll see blue dots at the bottom of these posts to let you know you can swipe to see more. You can like and comment on them just like a regular post.

If you're curious why they're messing with their "one picture" policy, it might have to do with training users to use the ad units Instagram is trying to sell: https://twitter.com/JoshConstine/status/834434138933338113
