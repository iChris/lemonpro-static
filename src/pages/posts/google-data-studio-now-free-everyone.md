[Google announced](https://analytics.googleblog.com/2017/02/making-google-data-studio-free-for.html) that they've removed the 5 report limit on Google Data Studio:

> To enable more businesses to get full value from Data Studio we are making an important change – we are removing the 5 report limit in Data Studio. You now create and share as many reports as you need – all for free.

[Google Data Studio](https://www.google.com/analytics/data-studio/) is used to pull data from your Google Analytics and Adwords campaigns and create reports that will look good in a presentation given online or in Powerpoint.
