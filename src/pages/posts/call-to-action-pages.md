The term "call to action" is a bit of a buzzword in the web design/development industry and has been for a few years. **Call to Action** is a term that describes ways to get the user of your website to do something - an action - that is part of the purpose of your website. Depending on your website, it can be a contact button where you'd like people to submit their name and email address for a special offer. Maybe your website is a service that you want people to sign up for. It could be that you have an e-commerce website where you want people to place an order. Or maybe you have a coupon or some sort of digital download that you'd like someone to get. ![Mailchimp Call to Action button](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-31-at-10.43.35-AM.png) ![](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-31-at-10.43.35-AM-1-720x376.png) It's a technique that's still popular because it does work really well to draw your eye to the thing the business/web designer wants you to do or take action on. It's a good idea to:

1.  Figure out what you want people to do when they visit your website. Maybe top two things?
2.  Does your website make it clear how to complete those one or two things you defined in step 1?
