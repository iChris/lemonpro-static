The reason we're able to keep doing ShopTalk week after week is because we have Chris Enns behind the scenes stitching together our tracks, fixing our flubs, equalizing the sound, and adding a little flair where the episode could use it. He makes it all work, while bringing new ideas and enthusiasm to the process.
