### Official Description

Maintainers Anonymous, a podcast from [Henry Zhu](https://twitter.com/left_pad), is:

> How can we work together to achieve a common goal: whether in our code, cities, or infrastructure? Henry Zhu chats with fellow maintainers across all disciplines of life on their process, motivations, and struggles as they learn in public.

### Sample Episodes

*   [Speed Running With Omnigamer](https://www.maintainersanonymous.com/1)
*   [Boundaries with Stephanie Hurlburt](https://www.maintainersanonymous.com/2)

### How it Works

*   Henry Zhu records conversations with his guest(s) and sends me the audio files over Google Drive.
*   I edit for content and any requests Henry has for changes, add intro/outro music, add his personal spoken outro, levels.
*   I send a mixed down MP3 with chapter markers and album art for Henry to publish on his podcast's website hosted by [Transistor.fm](https://transistor.fm/?via=chris).
