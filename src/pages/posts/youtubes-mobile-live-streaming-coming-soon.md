It was only a matter of time before YouTube got into the mobile streaming game with apps like Periscope and Instagram/Facebook Live building large audiences of video streamers. YouTube [announced plans to open access to their mobile live streaming capabilities to channels with at least 10,000 subscribers](https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2017/02/mobile-live-streaming-super-chat-live.html) - everyone else will get access "soon".

> Mobile live streaming has been built directly into the YouTube mobile app. All you have to do to start streaming is open YouTube, hit the capture button, and you?re live! Streamed videos will have all the same features as regular YouTube videos.

> Anybody watching a live stream can purchase a Super Chat: a highlighted message in the chat stream that stands out from the crowd to get even more of your favorite creator?s attention. And Super Chats remain pinned to the top of chat for up to 5 hours, giving more airtime for your messages.

I'm glad to see YouTube is taking the time to get mobile streaming right. With the infrastructure and experience of serving up video that YouTube has, it should be a solid platform to use for a business or brand to show what's happening **right now** to the world without having to know how to set up [OBS](https://obsproject.com) or [buy Wirecast](http://www.telestream.net/wirecast/overview.htm). If you're curious about how live streaming video could help your business, [talk to me](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/contact/) and I can tell you if it's right for you.
