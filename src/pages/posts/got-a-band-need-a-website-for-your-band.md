I often use [WooThemes WordPress themes](\"http://www.woothemes.com/woomember/go?r=359&redirect=www.woothemes.com/\") for client sites, particularly if the budget doesn\\'t allow for a complete, starting from scratch approach. They design great themes that are well supported and are built on a solid code base that allows for plenty of customization without having to reinvent the wheel each time you start a project.

Unsigned
--------

They\\'ve just released a new theme that is specifically for bands, singers or musicians that want to roll their own website. There are lots of websites and services out there to help bands get going[1](\"#fn-416:1\") but [Unsigned by WooThemes](\"http://www.woothemes.com/woomember/go?r=359&redirect=www.woothemes.com/2012/01/unsigned/\") is for the artist that wants to have full control over their site and doesn\\'t mind doing a bit of HTML/CSS coding or [wants to hire someone to help with that part of it](\"http://www.lemonproductions.ca/contact/\").

Features
--------

They\\'ve bundled in a bunch of great stuff, including:

### Events Module

Caters for the management and listing of events (gigs, festivals, etc). Events can be grouped into categories (club, concert, gig, festival, etc) and tours. An event\\'s status (upcoming, right now, past) is determined by it\\'s start and end date/time.

### Discography Module

Discography is where the artist manages their album releases. Albums can be sorted into categories and make up a cover image, unique catalog ID and a release date. Each album has an audio player facility, which uses tracks that are uploaded directly when adding or editing an album.

### Videos Module

Videos is where the artist manages their embedded videos from YouTube, Vimeo, etc. Videos can be sorted into categories and make up an optional posterframe and an embed code field.

### Soundcloud Integration

Woo - SoundCloud is a bridge between Unsigned and SoundCloud. When a username is specified, the system connects to SoundCloud and retrieves the user\\'s tracks and playlists. These two content types are outputted via a Woo - SoundCloud - Playlist widget for specific playlists and a Woo - SoundCloud Tracks widget to display individual players for specific tracks.

### WooCommerce

[WooCommerce](\"http://www.woothemes.com/woomember/go?r=359&redirect=www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/\") is a free plugin that enables e-commerce on any theme - but on [Unsigned](\"http://www.woothemes.com/woomember/go?r=359&redirect=www.woothemes.com/2012/01/unsigned/\") it allows bands.musicians to sell their albums and other merchandise right on their site.
