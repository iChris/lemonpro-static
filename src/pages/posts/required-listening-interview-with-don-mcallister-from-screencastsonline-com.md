If you're at all interested in podcasting and the business behind it, you absolutely need to listen to [this interview with Don McAllister](http://foolishadventure.com/audio/our-foolish-interview-with-don-mcallister-from-screencastsonline-com-fa022/) from [ScreencastsOnline.com](http://www.screencastsonline.com/) by Izzy and Tim, the two guys behind [The Foolish Adventure](http://foolishadventure.com/) website and podcast. ![screencastsonlinelogo](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/screencastsonlinelogo.jpg) Don McAllister is one of the first people I came across that was charging money for podcasting and instructional screencasts. It was through him that I discovered [Izzy Video](http://www.izzyvideo.com/), who started doing instructional video podcasts on how to shoot video and who based his business model on what Don McAllister was doing. Lots of great nuggets of tips and inside info for anyone interested in developing a new media based business or incorporating podcasting or screen casts into their existing business.
