### Official Description

[Chartable Radio](https://chartable.com/podcasts/chartable-radio) is:

> The founders of Chartable discuss all things podcasting, interview podcasters and dish the best advice on how to market and grow your podcast.

p.s. [Chartable](https://chartable.com) is a great service for tracking the rankings of your podcast(s). It's worth using if you have a podcast of your own.

### Sample Episodes

*   [Justin Jackson - Co-founder, Transistor.fm](https://chartable.com/podcasts/chartable-radio/episodes/30852152-justin-jackson-cofounder-transistorfm)
*   [Molly Beck - Founder & CEO, Messy.fm](https://chartable.com/podcasts/chartable-radio/episodes/32160863-molly-beck-founder-ceo-messyfm)

### How it Works

*   Dave Zohrob records interviews with his guests, usually one, and sends over the individual audio files via Dropbox.
*   I edit the content of each episode by adding intro music and cutting out any extra pauses, technical issues, or conversations as requested by Dave or his guest.
*   I send back a mixed down MP3 with chapter markers and album art for Dave and his team to publish.
