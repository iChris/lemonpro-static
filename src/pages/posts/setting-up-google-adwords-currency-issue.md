I'm posting this so that someone else doesn't make the same mistake I did. If you're setting up a [Google AdWords](https://adwords.google.com) account to advertise on Google searches, there's an option to set your currency during the account setup. And if you choose the wrong currency or miss it entirely like I did on a recent account setup, you cannot go back and change it later. Your only option is to close down the account and start over again. Here's the setting you need to watch out for: [![](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp45/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/adwordscurrency-300x143.png "AdWords Currency Option")](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp45/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/adwordscurrency.png) I completely missed it during the setup and then spent an hour hunting through options and settings, finally searching Google to find the AdWords support site where it says you have to close your account and start over. Frustrating!
