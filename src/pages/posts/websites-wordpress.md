### From .Com to .Mic

If you're a long time visitor, you may have noticed a shift in focus in late 2018 towards podcasting and away from building websites for Lemon Productions.

Which is true - it's been a slow transition but as podcasting started to take up more of my time, I gradually began to shift potential new clients elsewhere for website related work.

### Do You Still Help Clients with Websites?

Depending on needs, time line, budget, etc. I may recommend someone else for you to work with. Or your project might be a perfect fit for a gap in other work for me - especially if it involves any podcasting related fun!

The easiest way to find out is to [get in touch with me](/contact) and we can figure it out. I try to respond within a couple business days so you'll know right away what's happening.

### What About Current Clients?

I'm still just as passionate about websites, marketing, and the web in general. Podcasts live on websites! I'm not going anywhere - if you have a need that goes beyond what I'm able to help you with, I'll be sure to find someone that you can work with.

[Contact me](/contact) if you have any questions or concerns.

### Looking for Great Website Hosting for WordPress?

I've used a few different WordPress hosting companies in my 10+ years on the web. The one I recommend these days is going back to the source - [WordPress.com is a great platform built by Automattic](https://wordpress.com/create/?aff=14159&cid=1596105), the company behind WordPress, that is rock solid, fast, and much easier to use and maintain than dealing with a website company yourself.
