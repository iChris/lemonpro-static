This might have limited use for podcasters but it could be handy for building a library of screenshots of what your podcast looks like in various iOS podcast player apps or on the web: ðŸ”— MacStories: [Adding Device Frames to iPhone XS and XS Max Screenshots with Shortcuts](https://www.macstories.net/ios/adding-device-frames-to-iphone-xs-and-xs-max-screenshots-with-shortcuts/).

> The key feature of this shortcut is that it doesn't require any management on your end. Screenshots are automatically filtered from your photo library, and the shortcut understands whether it's processing portrait or landscape orientations based on the width of each image. Because assets are encoded inside the shortcut, you don't have to manually download any templates.

It's brilliant. And nerdy. And I have no idea how to replicate it for my iPhone 8 but I plan to try.
