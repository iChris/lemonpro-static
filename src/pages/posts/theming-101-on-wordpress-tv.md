Matt Wiebe gave a talk at WordCamp Winnipeg 2013 walking through the basics of theming in WordPress: \[wpvideo S0SAhsUU\] [Direct link to video](http://wordpress.tv/2013/06/30/matt-wiebe-theming-101/) As Matt says in the intro, his talk assumes you have never built a theme and are literally starting from scratch. You'll be looking at a bit of PHP code and HTML/CSS, but nothing too complicated. Matt does a great job of walking through the basics of making your own WordPress theme. Your completed theme at the end might not win any design awards - but it gives you a good overview of all the files and code that goes into a WordPress theme.
