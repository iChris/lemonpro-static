> Look, I get that I’m the nut who doesn’t want to use Facebook. I’m not even saying don’t post your stuff to Facebook. But if Facebook is the only place you are posting something, know that you are shutting out people like me for no good reason. Go ahead and post to Facebook, but post it somewhere else, too. Especially if you’re running a business. It’s 2017. There are a million ways to get a web site set up inexpensively that you can easily update yourself. Setting up a Facebook page and letting your web site rot, or worse, not even having a web site of your own, is outsourcing your entire online presence. That’s truly insane. It’s a massive risk to your business, and frankly, stupid.

I couldn't agree more. And despite my obvious bias as someone who builds websites in exchange for money I think it's ridiculous for a business to rely solely on Facebook or Instagram as their method of communicating. At the very least, set up a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com) for your business so that it can [show up in search results](https://support.twitter.com/articles/15349) and [cross-post everything there that you post on Facebook](https://support.twitter.com/articles/31113). One step up would be to register a free [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com) site that can also cross-post to Facebook for you. And of course, if you want some help getting a website set up and marketing advice on how to use Facebook, Twitter, and all the other services that come along - [do get in touch with me](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/contact/).
