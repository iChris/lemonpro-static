We did a really fun podcast years ago, but it eventually became more work than we could handle ourselves and we shut it down. Then we found Chris Enns and decided to give podcasting another try with him at the helm, handling the direction and post-production and all the details that take a good podcast and make it great. Chris frees us up to focus on the content and we don't have to worry at all about the technical side of doing a weekly show.
