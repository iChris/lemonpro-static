\[gallery type="rectangular" link="none" ids="1426,1427,1428,1429,1430,1431"\] Blue Mountain's website was previously a clone of their partner organization at [The Lighthouse](http://www.lighthousesaskatoon.org), which was done to help get a web presence started, but clearly deserves it's own look and feel. With this relaunch, Lemon Productions worked together with the staff at Blue Mountain to create a site that shows the fun, excitement, and adventure you can have when you plan your next visit to Blue Mountain Adventure Park.
