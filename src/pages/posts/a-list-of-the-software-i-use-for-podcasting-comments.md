Lovely list here, kinda gives me confidence to buy Auphonic desktop version. Can't find any other way to quickly get LUFS to -16! Been messing with this for a while, finally just think that Auphonic is the way! Also, do you use RX on single channels, or on the whole podcast once it's bounced down? I'm currently using de-noise just on my vocal channel, find it super effective!!! Anyways, thanks again, lovely stuff! Warmly Nate

Hey Nate - thanks for the comment and popping by to read. I dig using Auphonic a lot - Adobe Audition has gotten a lot better from what I've seen at handling this but it's still nice to throw an episode through Auphonic and just know it worked. My only hesitation in recommending Auphonic desktop right now is that it seems like they're due for a new version - it's just been awhile since they've updated in a major way and I wouldn't be surprised if they're working on some sort of direct plugin for Logic/Audition but I have nothing to base that on other than a gut feeling. The desktop version works great on High Sierra so it's certainly safe to purchase from a technical standpoint. I use RX on single channels. I hadn't thought of doing it on the master but that could work I suppose if everything is noisy or has too much reverb. But generally the edits I do are for podcasters in two very different styles of rooms/mics/etc. so I feel it's better to EQ/fix them individually. Have fun! The music sounds great! Chris.
