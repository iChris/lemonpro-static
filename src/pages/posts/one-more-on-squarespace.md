Over on my podcast network, [SSKTN](http://ssktn.com), we have a new sponsor called Squarespace. I mention this here only because a common keyword search that brings people to this website is 'squarespace vs virb' where they land on [this post comparing two popular website builder companies](/2010/08/build-your-own-website-virb-and-squarespace/). As part of the sponsorship of SSKTN, Squarespace has set me up with a complimentary version of their system and so I've [moved the SSKTN blog over to Squarespace](http://ssktn.squarespace.com/). \[caption id="attachment\_318" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Screenshot of SSKTN Blog on Squarespace"\]![Squarespace blog](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp45/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-09-at-9.52.32-AM-580x374.png "Squarespace blog")\[/caption\] It's a really powerful and easy to use content management system. It's not for everyone but I've been very impressed with how much you can do with a site without having to touch any HTML/CSS code. I'd invite you to [check it out](http://ssktn.squarespace.com/) and then let me know if you have any questions about Squarespace in the comments below.
