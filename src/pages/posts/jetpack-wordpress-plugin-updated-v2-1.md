Jetpack ([download on WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/)), the great plugin developed by Automattic - the folks behind WordPress - was updated today with a new feature that allows you to automagically create mosaic layouts of your photo galleries. Previously limited to a straight grid layout, now you can do rectangular, square and circular gallery layout:

> Create elegant magazine-style mosaic layouts for your photos without having to use an external graphic editor. When adding a gallery to your post, you now have the option to select a layout style for your images. We've added support for Rectangular, Square, and Circular galleries. By default, galleries will continue to display using the standard thumbnail grid layout. To make the rectangular layout the default for all of your site's galleries, head over to Settings ? Media and check the box next to "Display all your gallery pictures in a cool mosaic."

Take a look at the sample galleries below for an idea of how they'll look.

### Rectangle Example

\[gallery type="rectangular" link="file" columns="2" ids="713,714,715,716,717,718,719,720"\]

### Circle Example

\[gallery type="circle" link="file" ids="713,714,715,716,717,718,719,720"\]

### Square Example

\[gallery type="square" link="file" ids="713,714,715,716,717,718,719,720"\]

### Slideshow Example

\[gallery type="slideshow" ids="713,714,715,716,717,718,719,720"\] If you're not already using [Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/), I'd highly recommend it. Along with the photo gallery options there's other great features - [view Jetpack.me for full details](http://jetpack.me):

*   Notifications - Monitor and manage your site?s activity with Notifications in your Toolbar and on WordPress.com.
*   Publicize - Connect your site to popular social networks and automatically share new posts with your friends. (Although I personally prefer [Mailchimp's Social Plugin](http://mailchimp.com/social-plugin-for-wordpress/) for this.)
*   Stats.
*   Sharing - The most super duper sharing tool on the interwebs. Share content with Facebook, Twitter, etc.

And many more features. All free and you know it's going to be supported by WordPress because of who it's made by. So much better than using a random collection of plugins to accomplish the same thing.
