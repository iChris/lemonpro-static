\[gallery type="rectangular" link="none" ids="1924,1923,1922"\] Show Me Your Mic is a podcast I record, edit, and produce where I interview other podcasters about how and why they podcast. Covering the gear they use, the methods for finding guests, how they market their podcast, to any other tips or tricks I can dig up.
