The Business Advisor is a print magazine that has been published by [Banda Marketing Group](https://www.bandagroup.com) since 2005. In late 2017, Banda Marketing Group approached Lemon Productions about building an online version of The Business Advisor. In discussions about how to recreate the creativity of the printed magazine, we focused in on readability of the content. With interviews, sponsored content, educational research, videos, ads, and more content types potentially added in the future, it was important to build a strong foundation and keep things simple and clean. We incorporated the visual elements and colour styles from the print magazine, all the while keeping the text uncluttered and easy to track whether on a large desktop monitor or a smaller mobile device. ![](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/homepage-view-571x640.jpg)

### Advertiser Friendly

We've worked with online advertising with other clients, on both the publishing side with Google Adsense as well as using online advertising like Google Adwords or Facebook Ads to reach new customers - but for The Business Advisor we needed our own ad solution that allowed for rotating ads from other local businesses. The first edition of the redesigned Business Advisor is hitting mailboxes now. If you're not already receiving it, you you can [sign up to receive the next edition for free](https://www.bizadv.ca/subscribe-to-the-business-advisor/) - Canadian residents only.
