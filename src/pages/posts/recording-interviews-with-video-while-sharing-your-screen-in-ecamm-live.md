I answered some viewer questions over on my YouTube channel - [subscribe here!](http://youtube.com/c/lemonproductionsca?sub_confirmation=1) - about how to do a few things with Ecamm Live:

*   How do you share your screen with someone on Skype AND record a video of it all on your computer?
*   How do you share your desktop, then switch back to a Skype call, then back to you, then back to your Skype call, then back to your desktop. (_Kind of like the Old Spice commercial?_)

What is Ecamm Live?
-------------------

Ecamm Live, [available here with a free demo to try before you buy it](https://www.ecamm.com/mac/ecammlive/), is macOS software that allows you to live stream to YouTube, Twitch, Periscope, Facebook Live, or just about anywhere else on the web that supports live streaming.

You can pair it with services like [Restream.io](http://restream.io) or [Switchboard.live](https://switchboard.live) which allow you to send one video feed from Ecamm Live and then they'll rebroadcast it out to multiple services. So someone like [Justin Jackson](https://twitter.com/mijustin) can start streaming a coding tutorial or marketing chat from his computer and it will go out to YouTube, Twitch, Periscope, and Facebook Live - so no matter which platform his followers prefer, he doesn't have to limit the live stream to one platform.

Bringing a Guest on via Skype
-----------------------------

The really cool part of Ecamm Live is how easy it makes it to bring a guest, with their video and audio, on to your live stream. If Skype is running, Ecamm Live will pick up the video from it and automatically crop/arrange your guest(s) (_up to 5!_) into a nice video wall for a conversation.

Ecamm Live will also record a high quality video of your conversation so you can upload that to YouTube or whichever video platform you choose for sharing afterwards.
