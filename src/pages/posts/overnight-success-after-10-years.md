Biz Stone is the co-founder of [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) ([follow Lemon Productions here](http://twitter.com/lemonproduction)) and had this to say [in a blog post](http://www.bizstone.com/2010/09/timing-lessons.html) about the perceived overnight success of Twitter:

> Timing, perseverance, and ten years of trying will eventually make you look like an overnight success. Surrounding yourself with smart people you like to work with helps immeasurably. We've got a long road ahead and I'm looking forward to another ten years.

In the online world, where virtual things seem to happen virtually overnight - it's good to remember that success takes a lot of work, hard work and doesn't really happen overnight.
