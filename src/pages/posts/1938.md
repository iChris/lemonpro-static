Where Should You Stream?
------------------------

That's coming in a future blog post, but I wanted to mention a service called [Restream.io](https://restream.io/?ref=ygmz) that allows you to stream to it and then Restream will forward your stream on to a bunch of other streaming services for you. So you can be live on Twitch, YouTube, Periscope, Mixer, and more without having to manage connections to all those different services at the same time. Some services, like Facebook Live, require you to have a special stream and so to use Restream for that, you have to upgrade to gain access to Facebook Live streaming. Check out [Restream here](https://restream.io/?ref=ygmz).
