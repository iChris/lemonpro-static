The tutorial video this time is a bit on the silly side - but could be something fun to add to a webinar or livestream in the future. Snapchat recently released a desktop app called [Snap Camera](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com) that allows you to use some of the same lenses that Snapchat offers on their mobile app, but on your computer:

> Bring the magic of Lenses to your live streams and video chats.

In the video tutorial I demo Snap Camera inside of Ecamm's Ecamm Live for macOS, but you should be able to do something similar inside other video streaming apps like [OBS](https://obsproject.com). For example, I tested it out and Skype is able to see the Snap Camera app as a video source whereas FaceTime for macOS doesn't (yet). It could make for fun calls with friends or family. ![](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/snap-camera-inside-skype-720x551.jpg) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4yjah5ooEc [Direct link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4yjah5ooEc) Software demo'd in the video:
