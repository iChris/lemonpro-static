This is a [repost from my personal blog](http://www.chrisenns.com/2011/08/24/moving-on-to-something-new/) but I thought I'd put it here as well: It’s with a mixture of excitement, nervousness and a dash of whattheheckareyoudoingandthinking-ness, I’m happy to announce that beginning September 6th, I’ll be taking [Lemon Productions](http://www.lemonproductions.ca) full time. Phew. Said it. Now I have to do it.

Where I’ve Been
---------------

First off, this means that I’ll no longer be working at [YasTech Developments](http://www.yastech.ca). I’ve been working with Michael for almost exactly 2 years and it’s been a great pleasure to work alongside him on all the different projects that came across our desks. I learned a lot about running a small business, having employees and communicating with clients from Michael and I owe him a great deal of thanks for that. I’ve heard others say that once you’ve run your own business you’re ruined for working for others. And while there’s obviously exceptions to that rule, I can say that the little taste I had of working for myself just before starting at YasTech left me wanting to do it again. I knew it was going to be a matter of when, not if, that I would need to return to Lemon Productions full-time. And while it’s hard to leave the security, familiarity and comfort of a job you’ve been in for the unknowns of your own business - it really feels like this is the right time to take the leap.

Who’s Going With Me?
--------------------

I keep saying “I”, when really it’s “we”. My wife, Susan, and I have spent many days and nights thinking, discussing, praying, arguing and discussing some more all the scenarios and options ahead. There is absolutely no way I will succeed with Lemon Productions without her support and I am very thankful to have such a loving, adventurous wife that is willing to travel this road with me. There’s also friends and family that have supported me and listening to me ramble on, giving feedback and nodding in agreement when I go on about how I’d like to do things. They don’t all know it yet, but they’re being pulled along with me on this journey because without their support, we won’t make it either.

What Will It Look Like?
-----------------------

The core of Lemon Productions can be summed up with the tagline on the [website](http://www.lemonproductions.ca):

> Solving Your Online Problems

### What Does That Mean?

I love to help people get stuff done online. Helping a small business setup their website, social media efforts on Twitter and Facebook, email marketing campaigns. I like to see people’s eye’s light up when they realize the potential of what their website can do for them. Setting up an e-commerce section on someone’s website so they can sell the work of art they’ve created is an awesome experience. Another aspect is media creation. I enjoy making small, short videos that help explain your business, app, website or solve a problem you’re having with your employees. Video is a great way to show **and** tell what you’re trying to get across to someone. In short, I want to take the difficulty out of using the internet for your business or creative endeavour.

### What That Doesn’t Mean?
