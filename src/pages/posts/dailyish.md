Daily(ish) is a near daily podcast I record solo with whatever happens to be on my mind when I hit record. I originally started publishing Daily(ish) as a way to practice various aspects of podcasting - mic placement, editing, publishing on the web, etc. - without worrying a lot about the actual content. It has since changed into being a fun way to communicate ideas and thoughts out to some of our \[Goodstuff.fm\](http://goodstuff.fm) listeners.

### Official Description

Just as it says on the tin ? this is a daily(ish) podcast from Chris Enns.

### Sample episodes

#187 What Do I Find Interesting That Nobody Else Seems To? http://podcasts-1.feedpress.co/10587/dailyish-187.mp3 #177 Happy Monday? http://podcasts-1.feedpress.co/10587/dailyish-177.mp3

### How Does It Work?

*   I use my mic, iPhone for occasional soundboard, and record myself for 5-10 minutes.
*   I do some light editing, add music, and other touches before releasing it to the world.
