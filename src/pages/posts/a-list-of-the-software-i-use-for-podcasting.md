I use a variety of software for recording, editing, and producing podcasts. Just like many real world disciplines where you have a different tool for a different type of job, so it goes for podcasting. Here's my list of software I use for podcasting - current as of October, 2017.

### Logic Pro X

*   [$279 in the Mac App Store](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/logic-pro-x/id634148309?mt=12&at=10l4Ki) / [web](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/)

Logic Pro X is the main app I use for editing all podcasts. I make use templates so I can have intro/outro music, EQ settings, and other show details already configured when I start to edit for clients or myself. I also use Logic Pro X when I record my podcast like [Daily(ish)](https://goodstuff.fm/dailyish) or anything in person like this session at [7shifts](https://7shifts.com) here in Saskatoon: https://www.instagram.com/p/BSJVlelDhqp/

### Adobe Audition

*   [Various options for purchase on Adobe.com](http://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html)

I keep dabbling in Audition because I know lots of other podcasters who swear by it. I generally use it to try to clean up really bad audio as it has some pretty powerful noise/clipping reduction filters.

### RX 6

*   [Various bundles on their website](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/repair-and-edit/rx.html)

![RX6](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/RX6-720x415.jpg) RX 6 (or whatever version is current) is the secret weapon in the fight against noise, hiss, reverb, and terrible microphones. RX is a series of effects you can plugin to Logic Pro or other editing apps - or just use as a standalone tool to cleanup an audio file. It's not cheap if you're into podcasting at the hobby level, but if you make any money from podcasting/audio production, it's worth every penny.

### Auphonic Multitrack Processor

*   [$79Euro / $100 Canadian on Auphonic.com](https://auphonic.com/multitrack)

![Auphonic](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/auphonic-720x469.jpg) Once a podcast is edited, EQ'd, and otherwise massaged I export it and run it through Auphonic to get loudness normalization before sending it off to the internet or a client.

### Audio Hijack

*   [Free trial / $49USD from Rogue Amoeba](https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/)

![Audio Hijack](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/audio-hijack-720x375.jpg) I think Audio Hijack is one of the coolest and most powerful apps on the Mac for an audio nerd. It can be used to route audio from anywhere to anywhere else - and make sure it gets recorded. I primarily use it when recording live streams for the [@U2 podcast](https://goodstuff.fm/atu2/) on our [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/goodstuff_fm) so that I can get sound effects and intro music onto the video stream but also get the audio recorded for later in editing.

### Loopback

*   [Free trial / $99USD from Rogue Amoeba](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/)

![Loopback](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Loopback-720x508.jpg)

> Create virtual audio devices to take the sound from applications and audio input devices, then send it to audio processing applications. Loopback gives you the power of a high-end studio mixing board, right inside your computer!

Loopback is to modern Mac audio routing what Soundflower was to a previous generation - only it looks much nicer. This, along with Audio Hijack, make almost anything possible with audio on a Mac.

### mimoLive

*   [Free trial / Monthly or annual subscription model from Boinx](https://boinx.com/mimolive/)

![mimo live](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/mimo-live-720x399.jpg) mimoLive is the app I use for sending a live video feed to [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/goodstuff_fm) (or YouTube/Facebook if we wanted to). I use a bare minimum of what mimoLive is actually capable of but it could be used for broadcasting live sporting events, concerts, or anything where you want to have a couple of cameras, overlay text, bring in callers from around the world, and all sorts of other multimedia fun.

### Gameshow

*   [Free trial / $29 on Gameshow.net](http://www.gameshow.net)

![Gameshow](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Gameshow-720x473.jpg) Not strictly podcasting related, but I use Gameshow to stream any gaming I do on my [personal Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/ichrisplaysgames) - generally Minecraft with one of my kids. Gameshow works very similar to mimoLive in that it allows you to capture what's on your computer screen and share it with the world. It's focused a bit more on the gaming side with support for services like [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com) that Twitch streamers use to interact with their audience.

### How About You?

These are the tools I use for podcasting - but I know there's a ton more out there. What do you use? Which ones do you have questions about? Feel free to leave a comment below or [tweet me a question on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ichris).
