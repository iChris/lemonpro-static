\[gallery type="rectangular" link="none" ids="1903,1905,1906"\] Producing episodes of The ShopTalk Show is a lot of fun because Chris and Dave have so much fun recording their popular web design/development podcast. They're not afraid to mess around with the structure of their podcast from week to week - which keeps me on my editing toes. From 2 person back and forth discussions to 5+ person panel discussions, each episode of ShopTalk Show is full of audio goodness.

### Official Description

An internet radio show about the internet starring Dave Rupert and Chris Coyier.

### Sample episodes

*   [#186 Dave Goes Windows](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/186-dave-goes-windows/)
*   [#187 RAPIDFire #51](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/187-rapidfire-51/)

### How Does It Work?

*   Dave and Chris record the podcast and send their, and guests, recorded tracks to Chris Enns for editing, EQ'ing, sometime-sound-effect adding, show note taking, and jingle-fying.
*   Chris Enns then sends back the finished MP3 along with show notes ready for publishing.
