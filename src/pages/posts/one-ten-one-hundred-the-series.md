Remember that [creative promotion of Soapbox Wistia did back in September](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wistias-creative-promotion-of-soapbox/) where they hired [Sandwich Video](https://sandwichvideo.com/) to create 3 videos for them, each with a budget of $1,000, $10,000, and $100,000? Wistia is back with a documentary series called [One, Ten, One Hundred](https://wistia.com/series/one-ten-one-hundred) that goes behind the scenes of creating those videos with Sandwich Video. They've got 4 videos in the series - over an hour and a half of footage - that show the complete process from The Pitch to The Blockbuster. It's required watching for anyone remotely interested in making video for the web. For bonus material, I'd recommend reading [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/csavage/status/1055468554991079424) from one of the founders of Wista, Chris Savage, on how they pulled it all off. [This article on Stop Measuring Everything!](https://savagethoughts.com/stop-measuring-everything-8adb1118e0e5) is especially worth a read for marketers and data nerds:

> The only way to stand out and make “art” is to set aside what can be tracked in the short-term and make decisions that align with your values. That’s hard to do. Data, by giving you an “objective” standard of success, has a tendency to make you more risk-averse. But doing things that are impossible to track now is the only way to set yourself up for success in the long-term.

🎥 Alright. Who wants to make a video and [host it on Wistia?](https://wistia.com).
