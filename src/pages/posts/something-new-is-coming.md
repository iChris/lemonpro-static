In between working on stuff for my awesome clients, selling our house, podcasting and other fun stuff I decided to do a quick refresh of the Lemon Productions site. I'm still stamping out a few bugs, spelling mistakes and typography styling issues - but since I believe a website can be a more organic document that changes, adapts and improves I thought I'd push the redesign live. Plus there's nothing like a live audience to tell you when you're fly is undone! So poke around and let me know if you see anything amiss. And also let me know if you find things you do like and want to incorporate on your own website - it's what I do, after all. Chris
