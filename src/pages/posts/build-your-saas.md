\[gallery link="none" ids="1869,1872,1873"\] In a bit of a meta podcast - this podcast is about starting a company to host podcasts for other businesses. Jon Buda and Justin Jackson tell all about the ups and downs of running a startup together in 2018. There's lots of fun back and forth as they both bring very different skills and styles to the business: developer vs. marketer, slow and steady vs. fast and now, American vs. Canadian.

### Official Description

What does it take to launch a SaaS in 2018?

*   [Six Screens and a Powerglove](https://saas.transistor.fm/episodes/nerd-stuff-our-web-app-tech-stack)

### How Does It Work?

*   Justin and Jon each record their end of their conversations.
*   They drop their audio files in a shared [Dropbox folder](http://db.tt/czHe7sK)
*   Lemon Productions edits the files, adds in any sponsor reads, background music, and intro/outro music.
*   Then the finished MP3 gets sent back via Dropbox.
