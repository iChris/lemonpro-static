### Official Description

[Real Talk Javascript](https://realtalkjavascript.simplecast.fm) is:

> A weekly podcast where we tackle the challenges facing Web developers today and invite expert guests on the show to share their experience solving concrete problems while building real Web applications.

### Sample Episodes

*   [Episode 19: JavaScript Development - Should You Buy or Build, with Guest Wes Bos](https://realtalkjavascript.simplecast.fm/c5c08afe)
*   [Episode 15: Did You Just Screw Up the UI? with Ryan Burgess of Netflix](https://realtalkjavascript.simplecast.fm/ab884884)

### How It Works

*   John Papa schedules interviews with his 1-2 co-hosts plus a guest.
*   They record from wherever they are in the world using [Zencastr](https://zencastr.com), which automatically records each person on their computer so you maintain as high a quality audio as possible.
*   John sends me the individual audio tracks over a shared [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) with folders organized by episode.
*   I edit out pauses, tech issues, coughs, and other minor touch ups of the conversation. (_John and crew use a shorthand of saying "Edit Point" into the recording if they want to speak to me or signal, not surprisingly, an edit point. It works great!_)
*   While I'm editing, I'm also putting together the show notes for the episode including episode description, relevant links discussed or mentioned, and timecode / chapter markers for listeners to be able to skip around if needed.
*   John leaves clear edit spots for me to insert one or two sponsor reads - also shared via Google Drive.
*   I export it all mixed down to MP3, set up a new episode in their podcast host [Simplecast](https://simplecast.com), and put the episode in draft mode for John or myself to publish on the approved day and time.
*   We track everything that happens on the show with a simple [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/) spreadsheet, including which sponsors are needed, recording dates, episode titles, and publishing dates.
