Over on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/lemonproductionsca?sub_confirmation=1), a viewer named "Crazy Robot Lady" asked:

> I am attempting to record a multitrack dramatized audio work using just Farrago and GarageBand. I also have my Clarett two Pre USB set as my audio output device. My problem is I end up with either only my voice or only my background music track even though I have set up two audio tracks- one for my voice and the other for music. I also make sure to select my line in and or microphone for both tracks. Ummmmm any idea what Iâ€™m doing wrong here? Do I need Audio hijack in addition to Farrago and Garrageband to combine these two tracks into one file?

If you've been following along this far, you know that I'm a huge fan of [Rogue Amoeba](https://www.rogueamoeba.com/)'s Audio Hijack audio app for macOS. It helps overcome macOS' inability to have multiple audio sources in even it's professional apps like Logic Pro. In the video I cover how Garageband suffers from this as well and demonstrate how to use Audio Hijack to accomplish this.
