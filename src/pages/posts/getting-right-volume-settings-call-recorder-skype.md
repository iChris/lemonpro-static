[Ecamm's Call Recorder for Skype](http://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/) is a popular way for podcasters to record interviews with guests over Skype and maintain separate audio/video tracks for both sides of the conversation. Normally if you tried to record a call on Skype, you'd end up with one audio track with both sides of the conversation which makes it more difficult to adjust levels afterwards - or even edit out parts of conversations/dog noises from your guest's side of the conversation. While Call Recorder works great at getting both sides of the conversation into separate, editable tracks it isn't immediately obvious how you can control the audio level of your guest's conversation so that your recording isn't too loud or too quiet. There's actually a setting in Skype that you can adjust to make sure that everything sounds sweet - and it's easier to show you in this 2 minute video than type it all out so [watch it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=620rH0aLgQM) or view it embedded below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=620rH0aLgQM
