Thing that?s holding me back from updating my Snapchat course: I get really annoyed using the app now that the brand stories are prominent. And so much of it is stuff I try and ignore in the grocery store magazine section while I?m waiting in line to pay. I know it won?t go away because I?m sure Snapchat gets good money from Mashable to feature ?how to turn on your iPhone? videos. I think Snapchat is a great platform for fun or for very big #brands but I wonder about the time wasted on throwaway content for small biz. If you?re a 1-3 person small biz, do you have time to be creating stuff that you can?t reuse elsewhere? (Youtube, podcast, etc) I know I sure don?t. It?s also great for promoting an event via filters. But that?s a set it and forget it thing for the advertiser. Just be aware of what kind of content animal you?re feeding your hard work to. Is the poop that comes out the other side reusable?
