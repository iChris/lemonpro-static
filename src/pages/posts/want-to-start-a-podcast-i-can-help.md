In my spare time when I'm not helping businesses with building websites and communicating with their clients on the internet, I run a podcast network I confounded with two of my friends from the internet. [Goodstuff.fm](http://goodstuff.fm) is the home to a bunch of different podcasts, some of which I'm involved with and plenty of which I'm not - which is the fun part of running a podcast network. I get to help my internet friends get a podcast off the ground. Which made me think that I should see if anyone in Saskatoon is interested in getting into podcasting for their business. I really believe it's a vastly under-utilized tool at the local level.

Want to **hear** me talk about this rather than read it? You can listen to a podcast episode I recorded talking about this very idea: https://goodstufffm.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/dailyish-45.mp3 This is an episode of my Daily(ish) podcast [I publish on Goodstuff](http://goodstuff.fm/dailyish/45). You can also [view/subscribe to it in iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/pdcst/id815675012)).

  

### The Ask

What I'd love to do is find a Saskatoon-based business or two that wants to hire me at a reduced-reduced-from-my-normal rate to consult with them on setting up a podcast - every bit from the gear to get, setting up a website, getting listed in iTunes, SEO advice, advertising and getting listeners to your podcast, to how best to celebrate your first 100 downloads. Interested? Got questions? Throw your details in the contact form below and we'll start chatting.

### My Podcasting Experience

You can read more about me and podcasting on [SSKTN.com](http://www.ssktn.com) but the quick answer is I've been producing podcasts since 2010, I've recorded over 400 episodes of various podcasts. Curious about podcasting? You might want to listen to my podcast _about_ podcasting called [Show Me Your Mic](http://goodstuff.fm/smym) / [or in iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/show-me-your-mic/id602836998).
