There are currently 1,032 ways to record the audio from a Skype call and so naturally I wanted to record a tutorial video on how to do it for [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/LemonProductionsCa). [Rogue Amoeba](https://www.rogueamoeba.com/) make some of the coolest audio apps for Mac and [Audio Hijack](https://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/) is no exception. It's one of the few audio apps that delights me every time I use it because it's so powerful **and** fun to use. That's no easy feat in software. Anyway. Here's how to get your Skype calls recorded with Audio Hijack.
