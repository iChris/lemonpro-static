I'll be giving a talk at the January lunch put on by the Saskatchewan Professional Marketing Association group going over the basics of using Snapchat:

> Snapchat is a fun app to use once you figure it out ? but it can be terrifying for first-time users. Who's getting a picture of you and when? How long does it last? How do I make it look like I?m puking a rainbow? And how can a picture of me puking a rainbow help my marketing efforts for my business?

I think most people overthink Snapchat and mentally put it beside something like Instagram or Facebook where they have to have everything in order and planned out. But it can be used in a much more fun, light way than most other social media apps ? yes the face filters certainly are one way - but by showing a behind the scenes, less crafted view of your business/product/service, Snapchat can help humanize the people behind the web.
