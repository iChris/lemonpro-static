\[gallery link="none" ids="1024,1025,1026,1027,1028" orderby="rand"\] Working with the staff, volunteers and board at The Saskatoon Friendship Inn we were able to build a new website that helps them get the word out about what's happening at The Saskatoon Friendship Inn. For the month of December, 2014, PotashCorp is matching all donations to The Saskatoon Friendship Inn up to $100,000 - so [please consider donating and helping out](http://www.canadahelps.org/CharityProfilePage.aspx?CharityID=d27700).
