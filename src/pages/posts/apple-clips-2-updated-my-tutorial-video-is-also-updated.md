Remember two days ago when I published a tutorial video showing how to use Apple Clips? (See the [post here](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/tutorial-on-using-apples-clips-app-to-make-videos-for-social-media/)) I do! That was fun. And then yesterday Apple decided to release a brand new version of Clips with new features like selfie scenes for iPhone X, Star Wars content, iCloud syncing, and more. \[caption id="attachment\_1538" align="aligncenter" width="500"\]![](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cryhappy.gif) Me yesterday.\[/caption\] While the principles of what I had in my video still hold true in Clip v2, the user interface changed enough that I felt like I needed to put out an updated video.
