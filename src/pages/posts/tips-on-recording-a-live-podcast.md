Over on my podcast about podcasting, [Show Me Your Mic](https://goodstuff.fm/smym), my co-host Kyle and I talked about Kyle's recent experience recording a couple of episodes of [The Official Untappd Podcast](https://podcast.untappd.com) live at [The Great American Beer Festival](https://www.greatamericanbeerfestival.com/).

> Okay, so I’m flying out from California. What do I bring? What’s going to be the like most minimal setup that I can bring?

Kyle's got lots of great advice and tips for anyone thinking about recording a podcast in front of an audience:

*   Gear to bring
*   What to think about when prepping the space for the recording
*   How to approach a venue about doing a live podcast recording
*   What a podcast editor's view on a live recording and tips to make that process easier

Listen to the episode here: And if you're curious how the result of this recording sounded, you can check out [episode 30](https://podcast.untappd.com/30) and [episode 31](https://podcast.untappd.com/31) of [The Official Untappd Podcast](https://podcast.untappd.com) for yourself.
