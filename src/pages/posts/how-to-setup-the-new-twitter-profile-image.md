While chatting with [Tenille](http://feistyfrugalandfabulous.com) I noticed her Twitter page hadn't been updated to the new Twitter profile. She asked me how to do that so here's what I told her.

Steps to Update Your Twitter Profile to the New Profile Image
-------------------------------------------------------------

**Visit this page: [twitter.com/settings/design](https://twitter.com/settings/design).** If you're not already logged in to your Twitter account, you'll have to do that first. Then you should see something like this: ![New Twitter Profile Setup](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp45/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-04-at-3.26.24-PM-580x454.png "New Twitter Profile Setup") **Scroll down to the section labelled **Customize your own**.** ![Customize your own](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp45/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-04-at-3.27.40-PM.png "Customize your own") **Click on Change header** You'll be prompted to choose an image from your hard drive. This image should be something that's at least 1,200 pixels wide by 600 pixels high, otherwise it will get shrunk/squished to fill the space Twitter wants to use the image for.

> Recommended dimensions of 1200 - 600. Maximum file size of 5MB

Just so you can try something out, I've created an empty sample image for you to use - [click here to view and download the image to your computer](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp45/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/New-Twitter-Profile-Sample-Image.jpg) - but you'll want to come up with something more appropriate for your brand/image. Alternatively, you can visit [twitrCovers.com](http://www.twitrcovers.com) to find a nice header already sized appropriately. Once you select an image it will upload. **Adjust size if necessary.** Twitter allows you to zoom in or out on your image to create an appropriately shaped image.
