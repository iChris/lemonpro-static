Lost & Lemon is a podcast that started as a conversation between myself and my brother-in-law, also Chris, who was living in Australia at the time. We both were starting a business around the same time and we also wanted an excuse to talk more so why not start a podcast?

### Official Description

A weekly talk show about starting businesses on opposite sides of the world, but on the same internet.

### Sample episodes

#82 Married to a Lorinda http://podcasts-1.feedpress.co/10591/ll-82.mp3 #69 I Would Live in a Hole in the Ground http://podcasts-1.feedpress.co/10591/ll-69.mp3

### How Does It Work?

*   Chatting over Skype, I record my voice as well as Chris' on separate tracks.
*   We use Google Docs to share a collaborative document that we both can see during the recording.
*   I do some light editing, add music, and other touches before releasing it to the world.
