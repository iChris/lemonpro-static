I love [this post from Paul Jarvis](https://pjrvs.com/a/marketing/) not just because he's Canadian (which is always a bonus) but also because he nails what marketing really is:

> Marketing isn?t the same as telling people to "buy" or pitching what you?ve made. That?s only a singular portion of what marketing is, because: Marketing is a damn process. The final step of that process is asking people to buy what you?ve made. But unless you?ve done the other work to lead up to that step, it won?t be that productive of a step.

Marketing can't be the final thing you add on. It needs to be involved from day one ? or as close to day one as you can afford.
