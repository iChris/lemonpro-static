Frank Chimero is a designer and writer from Portland, Oregon and he recently gave a talk at the Do Lectures in Wales. His talk was titled "Do Things the Long, Hard, Stupid Way" and is a good talk to listen/watch for a bit of inspiration and motivation to think about giving and how in the digital world giving has changed - we share much more easily but giving isn't as valuable since everything can be replicated. \[button color="#F3DF41" text="dark" link="http://dolectures.com/lectures/do-things-the-long-hard-stupid-way/"\]Watch the talk - Do Things the Long, Hard, Stupid Way\[/button\]
