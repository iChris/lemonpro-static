\[gallery type="rectangular" link="none" ids="1112,1113,1114,1115,1116,1117"\] This is a project I really enjoyed. Getting to work with Malke Rosenfeld, editor of ALT/space "Teaching Artist Stories from the Field", on moving the site from Tumblr to WordPress and customizing a theme that helped serve the words that were being written for each article was a great creative challenge. This was also a project that required support for a tremendous amount of authors - [author page viewable here](http://tajaltspace.com/authors/) - each with their own bio and needing a list of the articles they had written. There's over (at the time of this post) 250 articles on ALT/space. So if you've never visited, now's a great time to check out the wealth of information available.
