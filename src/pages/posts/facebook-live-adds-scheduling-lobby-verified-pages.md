Facebook announced that they're adding the ability to schedule your live video streams up to a week in advance, which will make it much easier to build interest around a Facebook Live event rather than just announcing it as it happens. Via [Techcruch](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/18/facebook-live-unlocks-scheduling-and-pre-stream-lobby-first-for-verified-pages/):

> Today Facebook is rolling out Live video scheduling, scheduled broadcast sharing, and pre-broadcast lobbies to verified Pages. The plan is to roll out Live scheduling to all Pages in the coming weeks, and to developers of third-party Live API tools soon.

Full instructions are on [Facebook?s media site](https://media.fb.com/2016/10/18/scheduling-a-live-broadcast-via-the-live-api/). With [Periscope recently adding the ability to stream from a desktop app](https://medium.com/@periscope/periscope-producer-a-new-way-to-broadcast-live-video-d8d4f43204a7#.snxioabv6), you can be sure both services will be going full steam ahead in the battle to win the war to be the best place for live streaming video. Currently I'd recommend using Facebook Live unless you already have a sizeable Twitter/Periscope/mobile audience. Chances are your Facebook friends/fans are going to be more engaged and interested in seeing whatever you might be doing on video than a pile of strangers on Periscope.
