Facebook recently added the ability to schedule a post to appear - so you can have something appear at a specific time without having to be at your computer or smartphone to post it. For example, you might want to post an update of a promotion ending at 6pm without having to make sure you\\'re there to post it. Or have a new product announcement go out at specific time. Here\\'s how.

### Video Version

For those of you who prefer to see how it\\'s done with a screencast, watch this: Otherwise follow the screenshots and step by step below.

### Step 1

Go to your Facebook page and start a status update: ![\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-01\"](\"http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp45/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/schedule-a-post-in-facebook-01.png\" "\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-01\"")

### Step 2

Click on the clock icon in the bottom left corner and **\+ Add year** will appear. ![\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-02\"](\"http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp45/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/schedule-a-post-in-facebook-02.png\" "\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-02\"")

### Step 3

Once you choose a year, **\+ Add month** will appear. ![\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook\"](\"http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp45/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/schedule-a-post-in-facebook-03.png\" "\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-02\"")

### Step 4

You should get the idea here but just so I don\\'t put all these fancy screenshots to waste, we\\'l keep going. Choose a month. ![\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-04\"](\"http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp45/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/schedule-a-post-in-facebook-04.png\" "\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-02\"")

### Step 5

Choose a day. ![\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-05\"](\"http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp45/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/schedule-a-post-in-facebook-05.png\" "\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-02\"")

### Step 6

Choose an hour. ![\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-06\"](\"http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp45/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/schedule-a-post-in-facebook-06.png\" "\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-02\"")

### Step 7

Choose a minute. ![\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-07\"](\"http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp45/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/schedule-a-post-in-facebook-07.png\" "\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-02\"")

### Step 8

Write your post if you haven\\'t already. ![\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-08\"](\"http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp45/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/schedule-a-post-in-facebook-08.png\" "\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-02\"")

### Step 9

Once you click **Schedule**, details of your scheduled post will appear in a pop-up. ![\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-09\"](\"http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp45/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/schedule-a-post-in-facebook-09.png\" "\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-02\"")

### Step 10

When you click **View Activity Log** you can see a summary of scheduled posts that you have. ![\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-10\"](\"http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp45/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/schedule-a-post-in-facebook-10.png\" "\"schedule-a-post-in-facebook-02\"")

### Fin

That\\'s it. Your post is scheduled and you can go have a sip of coffee or your favourite beverage.
