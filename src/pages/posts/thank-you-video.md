As part of the farewell and thank you to the retiring Saskatchewan MB Conference Pastor couple, Ralph and Grace Gliege, I was asked to record and edit a series of "thanks" from various people involved in the Sask MB Conference. This involved setting up the camera, mics, conducting the interviews, editing the footage, and exporting the video for use in a variety of locations.
