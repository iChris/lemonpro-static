\[gallery type="rectangular" ids="1917,1915,1916"\] The Non-Breaking Space Show is where Chris Enns cut his podcast production baby teeth - working with Christopher Schmitt to record, edit, and produce an interesting and quality interview with the smartest folks in the web design industry.

### Official Description

Seeking out the best, brightest, and smartest creative people on digital art, design, and development. From workflows to life hacks, we examine why they do what they do and how they did it.

### Sample episodes

*   [Matt McGee - SEO](http://goodstuff.fm/nbsp/52)
*   [Micah Godbolt and Front-end Architecture](http://goodstuff.fm/nbsp/48)

### How Does It Work?

*   Christopher Schmitt records most episodes himself using either Google Hangouts or Skype and then sends Chris Enns the exported audio files.
*   Chris Enns edits content out (uhms, Skype drops, etc.), adds intro/outro music and intro audio, writes up show notes, and publishes it on the Goodstuff CMS once Christopher Schmitt approves the final edit.
