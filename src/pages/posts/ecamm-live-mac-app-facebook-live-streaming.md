Ecamm, makers of other awesome apps like Call Recorder, have announced a new app that allows you to stream video from your Mac to Facebook called [Ecamm Live](http://ecamm.com/mac/ecammlive/):

> Facebook integration means there's no need to worry about stream keys or complicated set-up steps. The app takes care of it all.

![Ecamm Live](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecammlive-720x404.jpg) At $29.95USD it's among the least expensive options to stream out to Facebook Live from your Mac. And knowing Ecamm's quality software, I'm sure it works as advertised. They've got a free trial [on their website](http://ecamm.com/mac/ecammlive/) so you can give it a try before buying.
