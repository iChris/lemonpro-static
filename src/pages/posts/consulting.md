If you’re just starting out and not even sure if you need podcast editing/production work, or maybe you’re looking for some ideas for what equipment to buy next, troubleshoot issues with Apple Podcasts, or just want someone to bounce a podcast idea off of, we can help you get unstuck.

### Book a Consulting Call

This is my response to folks wanting to "just pick my brain", who'd like troubleshooting for audio/video apps like Audio Hijack, Screenflow, Garageband, and any other podcasting related questions: \[su\_button url="https://calendly.com/ichris/podcast-consulting-call/" target="blank" background="#ECC862" size="7" center="yes" icon="icon: calendar-plus-o"\]Book a Consulting Call With Me\[/su\_button\]

### What Happens?

*   You'll see a live view of my availability in your own timezone.
*   Once you pick a day and time, you'll get an email (and so will I) confirming the details.
*   Within a day or two, I'll send you a deposit request for 50% of the consulting fee as well as details for how we'll proceed from there.
*   You pay the deposit.
*   We have a chat over Skype/etc.
*   You'll get an invoice for the final amount.
*   We'll celebrate!

You'll get my focused attention for an hour at a time to deep dive on whatever area you need help with.
