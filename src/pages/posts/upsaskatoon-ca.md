\[gallery type="rectangular" link="none" ids="798,797,796,795"\] I had the opportunity to work with The Lighthouse Supported Living on the website for their capital fundraising campaign with the goals of: **Expand** to accommodate growing numbers of homeless, high-needs and hard-to-house clients in Saskatoon. **Renovate** existing space into more shelter space, an atrium, a gymnasium, library, art and meeting rooms, classrooms, a new community kitchen and lounge and an additional room for staff and support services. **Enhance** specialized programming to help clients reach their true potential as active and engaged members of the community.
