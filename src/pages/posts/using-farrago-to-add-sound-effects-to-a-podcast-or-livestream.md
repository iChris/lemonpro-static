## What is Farrago?

Farrago is an app from Rogue Amoeba, maker of fine audio products for macOS, that functions as a soundboard on your computer. You can load it up with AIFF, MP3, or WAV audio files that then can be triggered with your keyboard, mouse, or MIDI device.

In Rogue Amoeba’s words:

> Farrago provides the best way to quickly play sound bites, audio effects, and music clips on your Mac. Podcasters can use Farrago to include musical accompaniment and sound effects during recording sessions, while theater techs can run the audio for live shows. Whether it’s providing quick access to a large library of sounds or running through a defined list of audio, Farrago is ready to assist!

Farrago is easily the best designed soundboard app for macOS. Unless you need more robust playlist and queue support that something like QLab offers, Farrago is the app to get for your audio playback needs.

Rogue Amoeba offers a free download to try it out, and then it’s only $49USD to buy it.

While you’re at Rogue Amoeba’s website, be sure to check out their Ultimate Podcast Bundle if you’re in the market for Audio Hijack, Loopback, Farrago, and Fission for a great package deal.

In the video, I also touch on a few other apps besides Farrago that you might be interested in checking out:

* Audio Hijack
* Loopback
* Ecamm Live
