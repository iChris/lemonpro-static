This isn't exactly a podcasting related video, but since I love all things [Rogue Amoeba](https://rogueamoeba.com/) I figured it'd be fun to talk about their recently released SoundSource 4 for macOS.

What is SoundSource?
--------------------

[SoundSource](https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/) is, in their words:

> Change the volume and output device for individual apps. Adjust your Mac's audio device settings and levels instantly, from anywhere. Even apply built-in and third-party audio effects to any audio on your Mac. It's all possible right from your menu bar, with SoundSource.

My version: SoundSource allows you to control where audio is coming and going on your Mac.

### Video Review of SoundSource 4

You can watch the video above or [watch it on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X58ahwN8Pr0).

### Getting SoundSource 4

You can download a free trial version of SoundSource 4 from Rogue Amoeba's website and then buy it for $29USD when you're ready to purchase. The trial version is fully functional but audio quality starts to degrade after 20 minutes like most other Rogue Amoeba apps.

### My Review

If you're too impatient to watch a 17 minute video on a quality macOS app, then my _Too Long Didn't Watch_ opinion of SoundSource 4 is:

If you've **_never_** reached for the little speaker icon in your macOS menu bar, then SoundSource 4 isn't for you. For everyone else, I think SoundSource 4 is worth picking up to make your Mac life sound sweeter.

Give the trial version a try and I'm sure you'll find yourself upgrading to the full version.
