I love the Editorial Calendar plugin for my food blog. It not only helps me schedule product reviews/giveaways in among the recipe posts I write, but also it helps prevent me from getting over-excited and dumping all my recipe posts into one week and having little to no content posted for the next couple weeks. I need a calendar to force me to have patience. ;-)

Great post Chris. I?ve use the Editorial Calendar plugin myself, but have since moved on to CoSchedule, an editorial calendar that also incorporates social media. You can check it out here http://coschedule.com/ Disclaimer: I work for the company. Thanks for the post!
