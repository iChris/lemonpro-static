A podcast that's about 17 episodes old that small business owners (virtual or real) may find interesting is one from Cliff Ravenscraft's [GSPN.TV](http://gspn.tv/) network called [The Virtual Assistant Podcast](http://www.virtualassistantpodcast.com/). ![virtualassistant](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/virtualassistant.jpg) I've listened to most of the episodes thus far and have found it to be an interesting window into the world of virtual assistants. I had no idea what was involved in hiring and using a virtual assistant, other than the stereotypical view of outsourcing some part of your business to someone in a foreign country for a much lower wage. And while that's certainly part of what virtual assistants can be, there's also a bunch of virtual assistant companies based out of North America including [Contemporary VA](http://www.contemporaryva.com/) who sponsor [The Virtual Assistant Podcast](http://www.virtualassistantpodcast.com/). Definitely something to consider, particularly if you've got a lot of repetitive tasks or things in your business that you don't enjoy doing and could easily hand off to an assistant.
