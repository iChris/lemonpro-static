I\\'m not sure if this is version 3 or version 4 of the Lemon Productions site. But it doesn\\'t really matter - it is what it is. It\\'s a responsive designed theme which is geek speak for it adjusting to different devices like an iPad or desktop browser auto-magically. \[gallery link=\\"file\\"\] A bit of downtime between projects as well as an obsessive need to tinker and play with things led me to changing the site around. More thoughts later - now, back to work!
