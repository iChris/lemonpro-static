A big change is coming to the post/page editor in the next version of WordPress. When version 5 is released, it will feature a new editor called [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) that aims to make creating different layouts and styles much easier right inside WordPress. Over the last couple of years, builder themes like [Divi](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/), [Beaver Builder](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com), [Make](https://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress-themes/make/), and countless others have exploded in popularity because of their ability to allow regular users to add almost any type of content block to a page when laying it out. If you've ever been frustrated that you can have a column of photos next to a column of text without having to hire a theme developer or reach for a plugin, you're going to love Gutenberg.
