p.s. [Chartable](https://chartable.com/) is a great service for tracking the rankings of your podcast(s). It's worth using if you have a podcast of your own.

## Sample Episodes

* [Justin Jackson – Co-founder, Transistor.fm](https://chartable.com/podcasts/chartable-radio/episodes/30852152-justin-jackson-cofounder-transistorfm)
* [Molly Beck – Founder & CEO, Messy.fm](https://chartable.com/podcasts/chartable-radio/episodes/32160863-molly-beck-founder-ceo-messyfm)

## How it Works

Dave Zohrob records interviews with his guests, usually one, and sends over the individual audio files via Dropbox.

I edit the content of each episode by adding intro music and cutting out any extra pauses, technical issues, or conversations as requested by Dave or his guest.

I send back a mixed down MP3 with chapter markers and album art for Dave and his team to publish.
