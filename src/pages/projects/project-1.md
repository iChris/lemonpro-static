## Sample Episodes

* Speed Running With Omnigamer
* Boundaries with Stephanie Hurlburt

## How it Works

Henry Zhu records conversations with his guest(s) and sends me the audio files over Google Drive.

I edit for content and any requests Henry has for changes, add intro/outro music, add his personal spoken outro, levels.

I send a mixed down MP3 with chapter markers and album art for Henry to publish on his podcastâ€™s website hosted by Transistor.fm.

## Where to Listen

You can listen on MaintainersAnonymous.com, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, or Spotify.
