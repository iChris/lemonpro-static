## Sample Episodes

<ul><li><a href="https://realtalkjavascript.simplecast.fm/c5c08afe">Episode 19: JavaScript Development - Should You Buy or Build, with Guest Wes Bos</a></li><li><a href="https://realtalkjavascript.simplecast.fm/ab884884">Episode 15: Did You Just Screw Up the UI? with Ryan Burgess of Netflix</a></li></ul>

## How it Works

<ul><li>John Papa schedules interviews with his 1-2 co-hosts plus a guest.</li><li>They record from wherever they are in the world using <a href="https://zencastr.com">Zencastr</a>, which automatically records each person on their computer so you maintain as high a quality audio as possible. </li><li>John sends me the individual audio tracks over a shared <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google Drive</a> with folders organized by episode.</li><li>I edit out pauses, tech issues, coughs, and other minor touch ups of the conversation. (<em>John and crew use a shorthand of saying "Edit Point" into the recording if they want to speak to me or signal, not surprisingly, an edit point. It works great!</em>)</li><li>While I'm editing, I'm also putting together the show notes for the episode including episode description, relevant links discussed or mentioned, and timecode / chapter markers for listeners to be able to skip around if needed.</li><li>John leaves clear edit spots for me to insert one or two sponsor reads - also shared via Google Drive.</li><li>I export it all mixed down to MP3, set up a new episode in their podcast host <a href="https://simplecast.com">Simplecast</a>, and put the episode in draft mode for John or myself to publish on the approved day and time.</li><li>We track everything that happens on the show with a simple <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/">Google Sheets</a> spreadsheet, including which sponsors are needed, recording dates, episode titles, and publishing dates.</li></ul>
