I've been building on the web ever since my parents hooked me up with a 1,200 baud modem and I discovered Geocities. 

In 2017 I focused my business on helping edit, produce, and consult in podcasting and video for the web. While I love building websites and dabbling in marketing, and still do on occasion, getting to work in audio / video with clients is my chance to come full circle to what I had hoped to do with I started Lemon Productions back in 2006.

I love working with people who have an idea of what they want to do but aren’t sure how best to get there. With the variety of tools and options available online, hiring Lemon Productions to consult on your next online project can save you time and frustration.

## Who I Work For

When you’re hiring Chris & Lemon Productions, it’s kind of like you’re hiring a team of 5. I don’t usually bring all of them to meetings, let my daughter write proposals, or let my boys edit podcasts – but helping you succeed in whatever you’ve hired me to do means I get to transfer that success back to my family.

By choosing to work with me, you’re supporting a Saskatoon family. And we thank you for that.
