          I love the editing you do on our show. You cut out the pieces when I’m
          looking stuff out on the web, and put in delightful little clips.

          Chris is everything we could ask for in an audio producer for our
          podcast. He is reliable, flexible, and creative. And of course, he
          makes us sound good!

          The reason we’re able to keep doing ShopTalk week after week is
          because we have Chris Enns behind the scenes stitching together our
          tracks, fixing our flubs, equalizing the sound, and adding a little
          flair where the episode could use it. He makes it all work, while
          bringing new ideas and enthusiasm to the process.
